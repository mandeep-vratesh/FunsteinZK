    <h1>TERRORISM - DOs AND DONTs</h1>
<h2><b>BEFORE</b></h2>
<li>Stay away from those areas that may have been the target of terrorism in the past.</li>
<li>Be aware of the conduct of people around you.</li>
<li>Look out for objects that should not be there, that cannot be accounted for or that are out of place.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances should any suspicious package be touched, moved or otherwise disturbed.</li>
<li>If at any time a package or other object is observed in an area where it should not be or under circumstances that give cause for suspicion, the Security Officer should be notified.</li>
<li>The area around suspicious packages should be evacuated to at least 300 feet in all directions.</the>
<li>There must be no mobile radio or cellular phone transmission within 300 feet of a suspicious package or object.</li>
<li>Draw a plan or map of the building area where the suspicious package or object is found to be given to police to assist them in locating the package.</li>
<li>Stay away from large gatherings or demonstrations.</li>
<li>Be observant and alert. If something doesn’t look or feel right, it probably isn’t.</li>
<li>When using public transport:</li>
<li>Check below the seat for any unattended bag / packet.</li>
<li>Be alert of someone leaving the train / bus without taking his belongings.</li>
<li>If you hear about any incident:</li>
<li>Confirm its factual accuracy and ensure it’s not a rumour.</li>
<li>Please avoid spreading any rumours as they can actually lead to an incident (e.g. stampede etc).</li>

<h2><b>DURING</b></h2>
<h3>DO’S</h3>
<li>Stay calm. Do not panic.</li>
<li>Remember that staircases and basements provide immediate protection from the blast, its effects and falling glass.</li>
<li>Avoid calling any one. Please send SMS only. Huge amount of load is put on communication infrastructure during an emergency.</li>
<li>Avoid crowds. Crowds may be targeted for a second attack.</li>
<li>Avoid unattended cars, trucks or other vehicles. They may contain explosives.</li>
<li>Stay far away from damaged buildings to avoid falling glass and bricks.</li>
<li>Hear television and radio reports to keep you updated of the situation.</li>
<li>In case of an explosion take cover under a sturdy table or desk if things are falling around you. When the situation is better, leave </li>quickly, watching for weakened floors, stairways and falling debris.
<li>Move away from exit routes to be used by emergency officials.</li>
<li>If fire alarm has not been activated, remember that fire doors will NOT be free swinging.</li>
<li>Break the emergency door release to enable fast egress.</li>
<li>You will know where you are in the building with the signs for the floors.</li>
<h3>DON’TS</h3>
<li>Do not run, you may be suspected as the bomber. If you are in a crowd, stay at the fringes.</li>
<li>Do not return to the impacted area.</li>
<li>Do not try to manage the situation alone.</li>
<li>Don’t stand in front of windows, glass doors or other hazardous areas.</li>
<h2><b>AFTER</b></h2>
<li>Don’t travel unless absolutely essential.</li>
<li>Return to the affected area only after approval from Emergency Response Personnel.</li>
<li>Seek counselling if you have been affected by the incident.</li>
