<h2>Pre-Attack Indicators</h2>
<p>Prior to a terrorist attack, there are usually behaviors and activities which are carried out by individuals, and these activities may expose the planned attack. This is the best opportunity to detect and disrupt the event. These pre-incident indicators will usually fall under one of the eight signs of terrorism. However, even if the activity does not fit into one of these categories and it looks out of place, say or do something. Preventing a terrorist attack is everyone's responsibility.</p>
