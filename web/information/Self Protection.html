      <h1>Protective Measures for an Explosion</h1>
      <p>Because most bombings occur in public places, your family should know what to do in the event of an
explosion. As with any emergency drill, parents should practice the following tips with ageappropriate
children and discuss what to do in the event of being trapped in or being near the scene
of a bombing. Remember, the goal is to empower your children with knowledge, not to frighten them.</p>
If your family is trapped in debris, you should:
  <li>use a flashlight to signal your location to rescuers, if possible.</li>
  <li>avoid unnecessary movement so you donâ€™t stir the dust.</li>
  <li>cover your nose and mouth with some sort of material that is nearby, to breathe through. Dense-weave
cotton material acts as a good filter, or you may wet the material before breathing through it to help filter
the dust.</li>
  <li>tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can hear where you are.</li>
  <li>use a whistle to signal rescuers, if possible.</li>
  <li>shout as a last resort, only. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amount of dust.</li><br>
If your family is near the scene of an explosion, you should: 
  <li>get under a sturdy table or desk if things are falling around you. When the items stop falling, leave quickly. Watch for obviously weakened floors and stairways, and be especially vigilant about falling debris. Do not use elevators. </li>
  <li>follow your family, job, or school emergency disaster plan for leaving and staying away from the explosion. Do not stop to retrieve personal possessions or make any calls or texts. Do not return to the scene because you will increase the risk of danger for rescue workers and your family. </li>
  <li>avoid crowds. Crowds of people may be the target of a second attack. </li>
  <li>avoid unattended cars and trucks, as these may contain explosives. </li>
  <li>do not stand in front of windows, glass doors, or other potentially dangerous areas, including damaged buildings. Move at least 10 blocks or 200 yards away from damaged buildings. Also remember to move away from sidewalks or streets that will be used by emergency officials or other people still exiting the building. </li>
  <li>follow directions from people in authority, including police, fire, EMS, military personnel, school supervisors, or workplace supervisors. </li>
  <li>call 911 once you are in a safe place, but only if police, fire, or EMS has not arrived to help injured people. </li>
  <li>help others who are hurt or need assistance to leave the area if you are able to do so. If you see someone who is seriously injured, seek help. Do not attempt to manage the situation alone. </li>
  <li>listen to your radio or television for news and instructions.</li>
